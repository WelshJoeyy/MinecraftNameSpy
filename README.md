Features and Cool little designs:

- Features the ability to search any Minecraft Player Username and get the UUID and Name History of the entered username.
- If no username is input, then notch will be used by default
- The Usernames head and name will appear as the title of the browser window
- Shows the current skin of the username in 3D Format (Thanks to MCAPI)
- Ability to change the usernames skin to your players skin
- Uses bootstrap so design and implementation will be easy
