# MinecraftNameSpy
View Minecraft Players' UUID, Name History and Skin. 

The source released may be altered to your hearts content, although it would be much appreciated if you were to keep the footer! Please respect the license! Shown below.
It would help me out a lot! Enjoy!

Features and Cool little designs:

- Features the ability to search any Minecraft Player Username and get the UUID and Name History of the entered username.
- If no username is input, then notch will be used by default
- The Usernames head and name will appear as the title of the browser window
- Shows the current skin of the username in 3D Format (Thanks to MCAPI)
- Ability to change the usernames skin to your players skin
- Uses bootstrap so design and implementation will be easy
